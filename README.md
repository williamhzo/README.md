Hi! Iâ€™m William ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Frontend Engineer from France. Passionate about design systems, CSS, UX and crafting intuitive interfaces.

Product-driven and user-first, I'm currently doing some Frontend at [Mansa](https://getmansa.com/), building the product and design system from scratch: from research and specifications to QA and impact analysis.
